#This yml file is going to declare how and where is going to initalize this container


#This is the top-level section in your docker-compose.yml file that defines all the different applications or components that make up your overall system. Think of it as the main container that lists all the individual parts of your software architecture. Each entry under services: represents a separate service that Docker Compose will manage. In your example, app-csv: is one such service.
services:
##This is the name you've given to a specific service within your application. In this case, it suggests a service that likely processes or handles CSV files. This name is used internally by Docker Compose to refer to this particular container. It will also be part of the container's name when it's running. You can have multiple services listed under services:, each with a unique name (e.g., web, database, redis).
  app-csv:
  ##This section defines how Docker should create the Docker image for this particular service. Instead of pulling a pre-built image from a registry like Docker Hub, you're instructing Docker to build an image from a Dockerfile located in your project.
    build:
    #This specifies the build context, which is the set of files and directories that Docker can access during the image building process. The . (dot) here means that the current directory (where your docker-compose.yml file is located) will be sent to the Docker daemon as the build context. Any files referenced in your Dockerfile (like copying source code) will be relative to this context. It's like telling Docker, "Here's the folder containing everything you need to build the image."
      context: .
      # This line tells Docker the name of the file within the build context (the current directory in this case) that contains the instructions for building the Docker image. The Dockerfile is a text file with a series of commands that Docker executes to assemble the image (e.g., specifying the base operating system, installing dependencies, copying your application code, setting environment variables, defining the entry point).
      dockerfile:
       Dockerfile
    #This section defines how directories or named volumes should be mounted into the service's container. Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers, and also to share files between the host machine (your computer) and the container.
    volumes:
    #This specific volume definition creates a bind mount.
# The . (dot) on the left side refers to the current directory on your host machine (where your docker-compose.yml file is).
# The /app on the right side is the path to a directory inside the container where the host directory will be mounted.
# The - indicates this is one item in a list of volume mounts.
# Effectively, this line makes the files and folders in your current project directory on your computer accessible inside the /app directory within the app-csv container. Any changes you make to the code on your host machine will be immediately reflected inside the running container (and vice-versa, although be cautious about modifying files from within the container directly during development). This is very useful for development as you can edit your code without needing to rebuild the Docker image every time.
